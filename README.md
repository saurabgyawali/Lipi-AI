# ðŸ§  LIPI AI  
### Tibetanâ€“English OCR and Neural Machine Translation System  

LIPI-AI is a research-oriented project that automates the conversion of **Tibetan script images into English text** through an integrated **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** pipeline.  
It combines image preprocessing, OCR extraction, and Transformer-based translation within a unified, modular architecture.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Developed under the **Student Research Council Nepal**, this project explores multilingual AI applications in **low-resource language translation**.  
The system performs three major tasks:

1. **Image Preprocessing** â€“ using OpenCV for denoising, normalization, and segmentation of Tibetan text images.  
2. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** â€“ extracting raw Tibetan text from processed images.  
3. **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** â€“ converting Tibetan text to English using a pretrained Transformer model.  

A lightweight **Flask API** connects the backend model to a **Flutter frontend**, enabling real-time translation demos for research and testing.
